Dutch Flag Algorithm



Moore's voting Algorithm - used to find majority element iff it occurs >n/2 times
    1. Start with the first element as the candidate and set count = 1.
    2. Move through the array:
        - If the element equals the candidate → count++
        - Otherwise → count--
    3. If count becomes 0, choose the next element as the new candidate and reset count to 1.
    4. After the loop, the final candidate may be the majority.
    5. Verify by counting its occurrences; if it appears **more than n/2 times**, it is the majority. Otherwise, no majority exists.

Kadane's Algorithm - 
    1. Start with two variables:
        - currentSum = 0
        - maxSum = the smallest possible integer
    2. Move through the array one element at a time:
        - Add the current element to currentSum.
        - If currentSum becomes less than the current element alone, reset currentSum to the current element.
    3. Update maxSum whenever currentSum becomes larger than maxSum.
    4. Continue this until the end of the array.
    5. At the end, maxSum holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
